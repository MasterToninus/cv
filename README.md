## LaTeX Templates Documentation

### `section_tmpl.tex`
This template renders individual sections of the CV, such as "Education," "Work Experience," or "Publications."

#### Features
- **Customizable Section Headers**: Dynamically inserts section titles.
- **Flexible Layout**: Supports list and table formats.
- **LaTeX Compatibility**: Escapes special characters.

#### Example Snippet
```tex
\section*{~{{ name }}~}
\ifx~{{ kind }}~list
    \begin{itemize}
        ~{%- for item in contents %}
        \item ~{{ item }}
        ~{%- endfor %}
    \end{itemize}
\else
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X r}
        ~{%- for row in contents %}
        ~{{ row[0] }} & ~{{ row[1] }} \\
        ~{%- endfor %}
    \end{tabularx}
\fi
```

### `home_tmpl.tex`
This template creates the main structure of the CV, including metadata, a cover statement, and a three-column layout.

#### Features
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Automatically fills in name, contact details, and links.
- **Three-Column Layout**: Organizes CV sections across three columns.
- **Customizable Keywords**: Includes keywords for emphasis.

#### Example Snippet
```tex
\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\usepackage{geometry, xcolor, hyperref}

\begin{document}
\begin{center}
    {\LARGE ~{{ name }}~}\\[0.2cm]
    \textbf{~{{ currentposition }}~}\\[0.2cm]
    \href{mailto:~{{ email }}~}{~{{ email }}~} | 
    ~{{ phone }}~ | 
    \href{~{{ site }}~}{~{{ site }}~} | 
    \href{https://github.com/~{{ github }}~}{~{{ github }}~}
\end{center}

\vspace{1cm}

~{{ coverstatement }}~

\columnbreak

~{{ body1 }}~
\columnbreak

~{{ body2 }}~
\columnbreak

~{{ body3 }}~
\end{document}
```

## Usage

1. **Generate the CV**:
    Run the Makefile to process your data and generate a LaTeX CV:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

2. **View the Output**:
    - The compiled PDF will be available in the `gen/` directory:
      ```bash
      open gen/cv.pdf
      ```

## Troubleshooting

### Scopus 401 Error

If you encounter the following error:
```
pybliometrics.scopus.exception.Scopus401Error: The requestor is not authorized to access the requested view or fields of the resource
```
This indicates that the API key you are using does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested data from Scopus.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Verify API Key**:
   Ensure that you have a valid API key from Scopus. You can obtain an API key by registering on the [Elsevier Developer Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com/).

2. **Check API Key Permissions**:
   Make sure that your API key has the necessary permissions to access the Scopus data. Some API keys may have restricted access based on the subscription level.

3. **Configure pybliometrics**:
   Ensure that you have correctly configured `pybliometrics` with your API key. You can do this by creating a configuration file as described in the [pybliometrics documentation](https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html).

   Here is an example of how to configure `pybliometrics`:

   - Create a file named `config.ini` in the `.pybliometrics` directory in your home directory.
   - Add the following content to the `config.ini` file:

     ```ini
     [Authentication]
     API_KEY = your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Check API Usage Limits**:
   Ensure that you have not exceeded the usage limits for your API key. The Scopus API has rate limits, and exceeding these limits can result in authorization errors.

5. **Test API Key**:
   Test your API key with a simple request to ensure that it is working correctly. You can use the following code snippet to test your API key:

   ```python
   from pybliometrics.scopus import AuthorRetrieval

   author_id = '57218509273'
   author = AuthorRetrieval(author_id)
   print(author.given_name, author.surname)
   ```

If you have verified all the above steps and are still encountering the error, you may need to contact Elsevier support for further assistance with your API key and permissions.

For more detailed information, refer to the [pybliometrics access documentation](https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/access.html).
