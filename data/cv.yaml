currentposition: "Ph.D. candidate in mathematics (geometry).\\ Expected to defend in December 2020."
coverstatement: "I am a differential geometer mainly working with higher geometry methods in symplectic and multisymplectic geometry. I am interested in geometric mechanics, classical field theories, quantization and homotopical algebra. Most of all, I am interested in geometrical and homotopical structures inspired by theoretical physics."
keywords: 
  - Differential Geometry
  - Multisymplectic Geometry
  - Axiomatic Foundations of Physics
  - Geometric Mechanics of Field Systems
  - Geometric and Algebraic Quantization
  - Categorical and cohomological methods in geometry and theoretical physics
