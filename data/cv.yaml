currentposition: "Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus  on  differential geometry (multisymplectic) and its applications to physics."
coverstatement: "I am a differential geometer mainly working with higher geometry methods in symplectic and multisymplectic geometry. 
  I am interested in geometric mechanics, classical field theories, quantization and homotopical algebra. Most of all, I am interested in geometrical and homotopical structures inspired by theoretical physics."
