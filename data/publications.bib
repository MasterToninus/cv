	abstract = {In this article a homotopy co-momentum map ($\backslash$`a la Callies-Fr$\backslash$'egier-Rogers-Zambon) trangressing to the standard hydrodynamical co-momentum map of Arnol'd, Marsden and Weinstein and others is constructed and then generalized to a special class of Riemannian manifolds. Also, a covariant phase space interpretation of the coadjoint orbits associated to the Euler evolution for perfect fluids and in particular of Brylinski's manifold of smooth oriented knots is discussed. As an application of the above homotopy co-momentum map, a reinterpretation of the (Massey) higher order linking numbers in terms of conserved quantities within the multisymplectic framework is provided and knot theoretic analogues of first integrals in involution are determined.},
